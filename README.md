# Survcube - My first made game with Unity Engine

Overall game was made in 2020 but now I had an idea to have it all available (meaning source code) for everyone who maybe is starting their journey as game developer and would like to have some sort of a reference how games are made (obviously speaking as amateur myself, I was no way close to program it efficiently, it was my very first programming project that I made). Feel free to change, modify, the game for your choosing. If even one person would benefit with the tinkering of the game, I would be extremely happy.
